#### Intro  
A terminal jekyll post generator, written in Node.

#### Install  
```
  npm i jekyll-gen -g
```  

then you can use ```jg``` in your terminal  

#### Usage  
jg --help

jg  

    -t, --title [title]

    -c, --categories <categories>  
    Add categories, add , to multiple words, no space  



#### Why this script?  
Every time, I should copy, modify the file name, title, time, categories;
about 60 seconds passed away.  
I may write more than 300 posts in my whole life, so I waste about 300 minutes.
That is unbearable.
